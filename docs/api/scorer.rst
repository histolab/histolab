Scorer
====================================
The goal of the ``scorer`` module is to provide the grading functions for the `ScoreTiler <tiler.html#src.histolab.tiler.ScoreTiler>`_ extractor. The ``scorer`` objects input a `Tile <tile.html#src.histolab.tile.Tile>`_ object and return their computed score.
