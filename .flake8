# # max line length is set to 88 in black, here it is set to 80 and we enable bugbear's B950 warning, which is:
# #
# # B950: Line too long. This is a pragmatic equivalent of pycodestyle’s E501: it
# # considers “max-line-length” but only triggers when the value has been
# # exceeded by more than 10%. You will no longer be forced to reformat code due
# # to the closing parenthesis being one character too far to satisfy the linter.
# # At the same time, if you do significantly violate the line length, you will
# # receive a message that states what the actual limit is. This is inspired by
# # Raymond Hettinger’s “Beyond PEP 8” talk and highway patrol not stopping you
# # if you drive < 5mph too fast. Disable E501 to avoid duplicate warnings.
